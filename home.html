    <h2 style='font-family:Palatino'>Welcome to Fweefwop!</h2>
    <p>Established in 2019, Fweefwop started out as a student-run club that fostered our common passion for cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to foster an active interest in cybersecurity and provide our community with the tools and awareness they need to stay safe and secure in our computer-dominated world. We want to provide a friendly environment that allows all interested to participate and increase their knowledge of cyber skills by participating in cyber security competitions, including but not limited to CyberPatriot, picoCTF, CSAW, and BayCyber CTF. </p>
    <h2 style='font-family:Palatino'>Meetings </h2>
    <p>Our weekly meetings are on <b>Sundays from 2:00-4:00pm online. </b> <br>
        Send us an email at <a href="mailto:fweefwopcyber@gmail.com">fweefwopcyber@gmail.com</a> to join and stay in loop. <br>
